    <h1>Alexandra Rivero's Recipes</h1>
        <p> My passion for cooking began as a child. It started by watching my grandmother make some typical Cuban dishes like empanadas, ropa vieja, and frijole negros.</p>
        <p> My mother also dabbled in the cooking world. She was the one who showed me the art of baking. Every family member's birthday was celebrated by a homemade cake. This tradition really solidified my love for baking. </p>
        <p> There was something so beautiful about putting in the work to create something delicious everybody would enjoy. Ever since then I've put in the time and dedication to learn more about the craft.</p>
