  <h1>Alexandra Rivero</h1>
  <p>My name is Alexandra Rivero. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. Growing up, I lived with my father Alex and my mother Sandra; hence my name Alexandra! I am a huge animal lover. I own three dogs and have been a vegetarian for 6 years because of this immense passion I have for animals.</p>

  <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are arts and crafts, trying new resturants, and cooking.</p>

  <p>Arts and crafts has always been my creative outlet. When the holidays come around, I am filled with joy when I get to create new decorations for the house.</p>

  <p>Trying new resturants has become a new hobby and considering how many resturants there are in Miami, it is something that will always keep me busy.</p>

  <p>Cooking has been a passion for me since I was a child. I love cooking for my friends and family, and it is something I take great pride in. The entire process of cooking/baking excites me like no other.</p>

  <h2>Life as a Vegetarian</h2>

  <p>Growing up, I was a very picky eater. My diet consisted of ham sandwiches, croquetas (a Cuban dish), and other forms of pork and chicken. When I was 16 years old, I stumbled upon a documentary explaining the negative effects of meat and showed how the animals were being treated. From that day forward, I never touched a piece of meat again.
  <p>This pushed me to be creative with the foods I was eating. Since most restaurants at the time lacked meatless options, I would use cooking at home as a way to eat alternative foods. Since it has been over 6 years, I have made tons of recipes I love to share with meat-eaters.</p>
