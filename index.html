  <h1>Alexandra Rivero</h1>
  <p>My name is Alexandra Rivero. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. Growing up, I lived with my father Alex and my mother Sandra; hence my name Alexandra! I am a huge animal lover. I own three dogs and have been a vegetarian for 6 years because of this immense passion I have for animals.</p>

  <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are arts and crafts, trying new resturants, and cooking.</p>

  <p>Arts and crafts has always been my creative outlet. When the holidays come around, I am filled with joy when I get to create new decorations for the house.</p>

  <p>Trying new resturants has become a new hobby and considering how many resturants there are in Miami, it is something that will always keep me busy.</p>

  <p>Cooking has been a passion for me since I was a child. I love cooking for my friends and family, and it is something I take great pride in. The entire process of cooking/baking excites me like no other.</p>


  <h2>Life as a Vegetarian</h2>

  <p>Growing up, I was a very picky eater. My diet consisted of ham sandwiches, croquetas (a Cuban dish), and other forms of pork and chicken. When I was 16 years old, I stumbled upon a documentary explaining the negative effects of meat and showed how the animals were being treated. From that day forward, I never touched a piece of meat again.
  <p>This pushed me to be creative with the foods I was eating. Since most restaurants at the time lacked meatless options, I would use cooking at home as a way to eat alternative foods. Since it has been over 6 years, I have made tons of recipes I love to share with meat-eaters.</p>

    <h3>Vegetarian Meals I Have Recreated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegan Calamari made with heart of palms</li>
      <li>Vegan Meatballs made from rice, beans, onions, and walnuts</li>
      <li>Vegan Tuna Salad made with chickpeas</li>
      <li>Vegan Buffalo Wings made from cauliflower</li>
      <li>Vegan Deli Meat made from tofu slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Passion for Animals</h2>
      <p>As mentioned previously, I grew up loving animals. My mother's father (my grandfather) is also an animal whisperer, which is where I believe I got my passion from. Every time he came over hr brought some type of animal over for me to see. This being said, it was no doubt I became attached to all these animals and begged my parents to keep them. They rarely said no to me, which leads me to my next point. I owned dozens of pets of all different species.</p>

    <h2>Future Career Goals</h2>
      <p>In high school, I was part of a graphic design magnet. Ever since then, I have had a love for digital design, marketing, and advertising.</p>

      <p>Entering college I was unsure of what path I wanted to take; however, last year I officially decided to chase my dream of being a graphic designer. I currently work for an attorney as his social media manager.</p>

      <p>I love what I do and I have big goals to finish my bachelors degree. After this, I plan on getting a masters degree in Advertising or Public Relations. Once I graduate, I will search for a job in this field, and hope to land a good job for a big company that will help me expand my knowledge on the field.</p>
